##An implementation of the gridworld example using the Q-learning algorithm

A simple implementation of gridworld by simulating a wildfire environment.
A agent, here dog learns to collect both the apples without entering a fire zone using Q learning.

While testing, I found that the path taken by the dog converges after the 35th simulation.

###How to run

python3 train.py
